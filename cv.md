### About me:


Since 2014 I have been working as an instrumentation and control engineer. Faced with Siemens controllers, I became so seriously interested in programming that I decided to completely change my profession. Having learned about front-end development, I completed a course on HTML and CSS at the UDEMY online school. Now it's my dream to become a junior front-end developer. Having such qualities as: patience, perseverance and craving for new knowledge, I will make every effort to achieve my goal!

                personalMovieDB.movies[a] = b;
                if (a != null && b != null && a != '' && b != '' && a.length<50){
                    personalMovieDB.movies[a] = b;
                    console.log('done');
